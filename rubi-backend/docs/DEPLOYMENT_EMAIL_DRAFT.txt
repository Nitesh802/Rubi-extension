Subject: Rubi AI Backend Deployment - Action Required (Mike: AWS, Nitesh: Moodle Plugin)

Hi Mike and Nitesh,

We're ready to deploy the Rubi AI Backend to production. This is a critical component that powers the AI intelligence for our Rubi Browser Extension and Moodle integration.

## Big Picture Objective

We're deploying an AI orchestration backend that:
- Serves as the secure bridge between our browser extension and multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Integrates with Moodle/Rubi to fetch organization configurations and user identity
- Enables AI-powered features in LinkedIn, Salesforce, Gmail, and other platforms via the browser extension
- Keeps all AI API keys and sensitive operations server-side for security

The backend will be hosted at https://ai.fus-ed.com and will integrate with our Rubi development instance at https://sales.multi.rubi.digital.

## Your Action Items

### Mike - AWS Infrastructure & Backend Deployment

Your documentation is in the GitHub repo at:
📄 **rubi-backend/docs/AWS_EC2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.txt**

This guide contains everything you need to:
1. Spin up the EC2 instance
2. Install all dependencies (Node.js, PM2, Nginx)
3. Deploy the backend application
4. Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt for ai.fus-ed.com
5. Set up environment variables and PM2 process management

Expected time: 4-6 hours

### Nitesh - Moodle Plugin Installation

Your documentation is in the GitHub repo at:
📄 **rubi-backend/local_rubi_ai_admin/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md**

The plugin folder you need to install is:
📁 **rubi-backend/local_rubi_ai_admin/**

This guide walks you through:
1. Installing the plugin on https://sales.multi.rubi.digital
2. Configuring API endpoints and authentication
3. Setting up organization configurations
4. Testing the integration endpoints

Expected time: 1-2 hours

## Critical Coordination Point

Before you start, you both need to agree on two shared secrets:

1. **JWT Secret**: A 32+ character string for identity token validation
2. **API Token**: A 32+ character string for backend-to-Moodle authentication

These MUST be identical on both sides. I suggest you coordinate on Slack/Teams to generate and share these securely.

## GitHub Repository

Repository: https://github.com/[your-org]/Rubi_Browser_Extension
Branch: main

Both of your guides are in the rubi-backend folder. There's also a team coordination document at:
📄 **rubi-backend/docs/DEPLOYMENT_TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md**

## Success Criteria

Once both parts are deployed, we should be able to:
1. Access https://ai.fus-ed.com/api/health and get a healthy response
2. Have the backend successfully fetch config from Moodle
3. Test the browser extension making AI-powered analysis of LinkedIn profiles
4. See proper authentication and org configuration working end-to-end

## Next Steps

1. Review your respective documentation
2. Coordinate on the shared secrets
3. Mike deploys the backend infrastructure first
4. Nitesh installs the Moodle plugin
5. We test the integration together

Please confirm receipt and let me know if you have any questions. Can we target completion by [DATE]?

Also, please track your progress in our project channel and flag any blockers immediately.

Thanks for your help getting this critical infrastructure live!

Best,
[Your name]
